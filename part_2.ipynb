    "# Part 2: Getting familiar with TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "*TensorFlow* is one of the most popular deep learning framework developed by Google. If you are new to TensorFlow, please read and play with the sample in [Getting started with TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started) to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Learning Objective:</b> In Part 1, you implemented a fully connected network from scratch on your own. Very tedious to do it all by yourself, right? Well, we actually feel the same thing, that's why we are using tools instead of doing everything from scratch, lonely and depressed. For this part of the assignment, we will familiarize you with a widely-used deep learning framework developed by Google, TensorFlow and walk you through convolutional neural networks and show how to train them.\n",
    "* <b>Provided Codes:</b> We provide the Template class for a simple CNN model as BaseModel, predefined skeletons for conv2d() and max_pool(), as well as the dataset preprocessing parts.\n",
    "* <b>TODOs:</b> You are asked to implement the BaseModel following the detailed instrunctions and design your own model in YourModel to achieve a reasonably good performance for classification task on CIFAR-10 dataset."
