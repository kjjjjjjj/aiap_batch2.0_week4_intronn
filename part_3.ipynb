    "# Part 3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\n",
    "In the previous part, you implemented a multilayer perceptron network on CIFAR-10. The implementation was simple but not very modular since the loss and gradient were computed in a single monolithic function. This is manageable for a simple two-layer network, but would become impractical as you move to bigger models. Ideally, you want to build networks using a more modular design so that you can implement different layer types in isolation and then snap them together into models with different architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of exercise, you will implement a close to state-of-the-art deep learning model for CIFAR-10 with the Keras Deep Learning library. The fully-connected networks using a more modular approach. For each layer, you need to implement a `forward` and a `backward` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing a bunch of layers this way, you will be able to easily combine them to build classifiers with different architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to implementing fully-connected networks of arbitrary depth, you will need to explore different update rules for optimization, and introduce **Dropout** as a regularizer, **Batch Normalization** and **Data Augmentation** as a tool to more efficiently optimize deep networks.\n",
    "\n",

    "[Dropout](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a/srivastava14a.pdf?utm_content=buffer79b43&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) is a regularization technique for overfitting in neural networks by preventing complex co-adaptations on training data. It is a very efficient way of performing model averaging with neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Batch Normalization](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c1ba/ed41e4bc9401b1b2ec8ef55ba45543f7a1a3.pdf) is a technique to provide any layer in a neural network with inputs that are zero mean/unit variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Data Augmentation](https://medium.com/nanonets/how-to-use-deep-learning-when-you-have-limited-data-part-2-data-augmentation-c26971dc8ced) means increasing the number of data points. In terms of images, it may mean that increasing the number of images in the dataset."
