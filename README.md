# AIAP 2.0 Week 4 Assignment

## The objective of this assignment
* Implement the forward and backward passes as well as the neural network training procedure
* Implement the widely-used optimizers and training tricks including dropout
* Get familiar with TensorFlow by training and designing a network on your own
* Learn how to fine-tune trained networks
* Visualize the learned weights and activation maps of a ConvNet
* Use Grad-CAM to visualize and reason why ConvNet makes certain predictions


## Assigment Materials

### Part 1: Basics of Neural Networks (35 points)
The IPython Notebook `Problem_1.ipynb` will walk you through implementing the basic neural networks.

### Part 2: Getting familiar with TensorFlow (25 points)
The IPython Notebook `Problem_2.ipynb` will help you have a better understanding of implementing a simple ConvNet in Tensorflow.

### Part 3: Training and Fine-tuning on Fashion MNIST and MNIST (15 points)
The IPython Notebook `Problem_3.ipynb` will walk you through training a neural network from scratch on a datase and fine-tuning on another dataset.
