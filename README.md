## Assigment Materials

### Part 1: Initial exploration 
The section of the Notebook `part_1.ipynb` will walk you through by exploring/transforming data and image classification by using simple kNN classifier in CIFAR-10 dataset.

### Part 2: Get familiar with Keras by training and designing a multi layer perceptrons (MLP) network on your own 
The section of the Notebook `part_2.ipynb` will help you have a better understanding of implementing a multi layer perceptrons (MLP) in Keras.

### Part 3: Training and Fine-tuning on Fashion MNIST and MNIST 
The section of the Notebook `part_3.ipynb` will walk you through by implement the forward and backward passes as well as the CNN neural network training procedure and also implement the widely-used optimizers and training tricks.
